## Bugs Found & Fixed

### 1. Missing Screen Reader Announcements ✅ FIXED

**Severity**: High (Accessibility Violation)  
**Issue**: Screen reader users were not notified of matches, mismatches, or streak bonuses.

**Details**:
- `announceMatch()`, `announceMismatch()`, and `announceStreakBonus()` methods existed in `AccessibilityManager` but were never called
- No announcements for pause/resume/restart actions
- No game start announcements

**Fix Applied**:
- Added match/mismatch detection in `handleCardClick()` after match check completes
- Added streak bonus detection (detected when score increases by 15 instead of 10)
- Added announcements for pause/resume/restart actions
- Added game start announcement when difficulty changes

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main.js`: Added announcement calls in `handleCardClick()`, pause/resume handlers, restart handlers, and difficulty change handler

**Testing Required**:
- [ ] Verify screen reader announces "Match found! +10 points" on matches
- [ ] Verify screen reader announces "No match. -2 points" on mismatches
- [ ] Verify screen reader announces "Streak bonus! +5 points" every 3rd match
- [ ] Verify screen reader announces pause/resume/restart actions
- [ ] Verify screen reader announces game start when difficulty changes

### 2. Timer UI Not Updating Continuously ✅ FIXED

**Severity**: High (Functional Bug)  
**Issue**: Timer display only updated when cards were flipped, not continuously every second.

**Details**:
- Timer in `game.js` updates `elapsedTime` every 1000ms via `setInterval`
- UI only updated when `updateStats()` was called manually (on card flip)
- Timer display would appear "frozen" until next card interaction

**Fix Applied**:
- Added `startTimerUpdates()` method in `MemoryGameApp` that runs a 1000ms interval
- Interval checks if timer is running (`startTime !== null`), not paused (`!isPaused`), and not won (`!isWon`)
- Continuously calls `renderer.updateStats()` to update timer display

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main.js`: Added `startTimerUpdates()`, `stopTimerUpdates()`, and call to `startTimerUpdates()` in `init()`

**Testing Required**:
- [ ] Verify timer updates every second during active gameplay
- [ ] Verify timer pauses when pause button is clicked
- [ ] Verify timer resumes when resume button is clicked
- [ ] Verify timer stops when game is won
- [ ] Verify timer resets when game is restarted

### 3. Focus Trap Not Implemented ✅ FIXED

**Severity**: High (Accessibility Violation — WCAG 2.2 AA)  
**Issue**: Modal focus trap was defined but never called, allowing users to tab outside the modal.

**Details**:
- `trapFocusInModal()` method exists in `AccessibilityManager` but was never invoked
- Modal did not trap focus, violating WCAG 2.1.2 (No Keyboard Trap) guidelines
- Users could tab out of modal and lose context

**Fix Applied**:
- Added call to `this.a11y.trapFocusInModal(modal)` in `showWinModal()`
- Added call to `this.a11y.closeModalAndRestoreFocus()` in `closeWinModal()` to restore focus
- Removed duplicate Escape key handler from `a11y.js` (kept only in `main.js`)

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main.js`: Added focus trap setup in `showWinModal()`, added focus restoration in `closeWinModal()`
- `src/modules/a11y.js`: Removed duplicate Escape handler, refactored `closeModalAndRestoreFocus()` to only handle focus (not visibility)

**Testing Required**:
- [ ] Verify Tab key cycles only within modal (Play Again button)
- [ ] Verify Shift+Tab cycles backward within modal
- [ ] Verify Tab cannot escape modal to background content
- [ ] Verify Escape key closes modal and restores focus to last card/control
- [ ] Verify focus is visible on modal button

---

### 4. Redundant Win Condition Check ✅ FIXED

**Severity**: Low (Code Quality)  
**Issue**: Win condition checked twice — once immediately (always false) and once after match check.

**Details**:
- Win condition checked immediately after card flip (line 121) — this is always false because `checkMatch()` runs asynchronously
- Win condition checked again after setTimeout (line 114) — this is the correct check
- Immediate check was redundant and could cause confusion

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed redundant immediate win check
- Kept only the win check inside setTimeout after match check completes

**Files Modified**:
- `src/main.js`: Removed redundant `if (this.game.getState().isWon)` check at line 121

**Testing Required**:
- [ ] Verify win modal appears when all cards are matched
- [ ] Verify win modal shows correct time, score, and best time
- [ ] Verify timer stops when win condition is reached

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### Duplicate Event Handler Removal ✅ FIXED

**Issue**: Escape key handler was attached to modal in both `main.js` and `a11y.js`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed duplicate handler from `a11y.js`
- Kept handler in `main.js` for consistency
- Added comment explaining why handler is only in main.js

## Testing Checklist

### Manual UI Testing Required

#### Game Initialization
- [ ] Game loads with medium difficulty board rendered
- [ ] All cards show face-down ("?")
- [ ] Timer, score, and moves all show 0
- [ ] Best scores panel displays correctly

#### Card Interactions
- [ ] Click card flips it to show icon
- [ ] Keyboard (Enter/Space) flips focused card
- [ ] Second card flip triggers match check after 800ms
- [ ] Matching cards stay flipped
- [ ] Mismatching cards flip back after 800ms

#### Match Detection & Scoring
- [ ] Match increases score by 10
- [ ] Mismatch decreases score by 2
- [ ] Streak bonus (+5) triggers every 3rd match
- [ ] Score never goes below 0

#### Timer Functionality
- [ ] Timer starts on first card flip
- [ ] Timer updates every second during gameplay
- [ ] Timer pauses when pause button clicked
- [ ] Timer resumes when resume button clicked
- [ ] Timer stops when game is won
- [ ] Timer resets when game restarted

#### Difficulty Selection
- [ ] Changing difficulty resets game and renders new board
- [ ] Easy shows 4×3 grid (12 cards)
- [ ] Medium shows 4×4 grid (16 cards)
- [ ] Hard shows 6×4 grid (24 cards)

#### Restart Functionality
- [ ] Restart button resets game
- [ ] R key restarts game
- [ ] All cards reset to face-down
- [ ] Timer, score, moves reset to 0

#### Win Condition
- [ ] Win modal appears when all pairs matched
- [ ] Modal shows correct final time
- [ ] Modal shows correct final score
- [ ] Modal shows best time (or "--" if none)
- [ ] Best score saves to localStorage if better

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- [ ] R key restarts game
- [ ] P key pauses/resumes game

- [ ] Enter/Space key flips focused card
- [ ] Arrow keys navigate card grid

#### Accessibility
- [ ] Screen reader announces matches

- [ ] Screen reader announces win
- [ ] Modal focus trap works (Tab cycles within modal)
- [ ] Focus visible on all interactive elements

- [ ] Controls wrap on small screens
- [ ] Stats wrap on small screens
- [ ] Best scores grid: 2 columns (mobile) → 3 columns (desktop)

#### Motion Reduction

## Automated Test Status

**Note**: Automated tests could not be run due to npm permissions issue on mounted drive. All unit tests should be verified when permissions allow.

**Expected Test Results**:
- All existing unit tests should pass
- No new tests added (changes are bug fixes, not new features)

---

## Linting Status

✅ **All files pass ESLint checks**
- No linting errors in `src/main.js`
- No linting errors in `src/modules/a11y.js`
- All code follows project style guidelines

---

## Performance Considerations

### Timer Update Interval
- Timer UI updates every 1000ms via `setInterval`
- Interval checks game state before updating (efficient)
- Interval continues running but skips updates when game paused/won
- **Note**: Consider cleanup if app lifecycle management is added in future

### Screen Reader Announcements
- Announcements use 100ms setTimeout to clear previous content
- Prevents announcement queue issues
- Uses `aria-live="polite"` for non-intrusive updates

---

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Manual Testing**: Complete all manual testing checklist items above
2. **Browser Testing**: Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
3. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with NVDA (Windows), JAWS (Windows), VoiceOver (macOS/iOS)
4. **Performance Testing**: Verify 60 FPS animations on low-end devices
5. **Accessibility Audit**: Run Lighthouse accessibility audit (target: ≥95)
6. **Unit Tests**: Run `npm test` when permissions allow to verify all tests pass
